  <p>Once I went on a school trip to Virginia Beach and Washington D.C.<br>We went on this trip to visit different colleges.<br>We stayed at this hotel in Virginia Beach that was on the bay.<br>There was a sign there that said<mark>"Do Not Swim In The Bay"</mark>.<br>Well one of my classmates decided to get in the bay. Everyone was telling him not to do it but he did it anyway.<br>Well, while he was in the bay he ended up getting stung by a jellyfish.<br>It wasn't funny at first but it became funny because he wouldn't listen to anyone. That's why it's important to follow the rules.</p>

    <p>Another place that we visited was the American Art Museum. It was a beautiful place and a lot of famous people have visited it.<br> I really enjoyed the museum and I had a great time.</p>
