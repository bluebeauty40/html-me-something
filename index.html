<p>Once I went on a school trip to Virginia Beach and Washington D.C. We went on this trip to visit different colleges. We stayed at this hotel in Virginia that was on the bay. There was a sign there that said<mark>"Do Not Swim In The Bay"</mark>. Well one of my classmates decided to get in the bay. Everyone was telling him not to do it but he did it anyway. Well, while he was in the bay he ended up getting stung by a jellyfish. It wasn't funny at first but it became funny because he wouldn't listen to anyone. That's why it's important to follow the rules. We also visited Washington D.C. We seen The White House, The Smithsonian, and The American Art Museum. It was an amazing trip. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun.  </p>
